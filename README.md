# smallsat-steward

The future home of SmallSat Steward, a set of algorithms for planning and control under model failures. Designed with application scenario of microgravity robotics free-flyer inspection, SmallSat Steward's algorithms are widely applicable to robotic systemes that experience model failures or degradation. Testing of Steward's algorithms is enabled via interface with Steward's [SmallSatSim environment](https://github.com/albee/smallsat-sim).

SmallSat Steward is a collaboration between researchers at Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of Michigan's Space Systems Laboratory.
